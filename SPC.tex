\section{Single Point Energy Calculation}
\subsection{Using HF}
\subsubsection{Using DEF2-SVP basis set}
Here we are going to calculate the single point energy for $H_2O$ molecule using Hartree Fock method with DEF2-SVP basis \vspace{1cm}set.\\
The input file is given below.
\begin{minted}{python}
! HF DEF2-SVP
* xyz 0 1
O     -0.222442    1.095097   -0.000000
H      0.487836    0.874579    0.591082
H      0.063978    1.773709   -0.599958
*
\end{minted}

In the out put file obtained we can see a section with \textbf{Final Single Point Energy = -75.960755945571}

\subsubsection{UHF and Spin Contamination}
When we change the multiplicity from 1 to 2 by changing the charge from 0 to 1 the resulting output file have this spin contamination section. Here the UHF calculation is performed.
\paragraph{}

The input file is as given below.

\begin{minted}{python}
# Changing multiplicity from 1 to 3 
# And will check the spin contamination

!HF DEF2-SVP
* xyz 1 2
O     -0.222442    1.095097   -0.000000
H      0.487836    0.874579    0.591082
H      0.063978    1.773709   -0.599958

\end{minted}

\paragraph{}
The output file contains the following section with title UHF spin contamination\\

$----------------------$ \\
UHF SPIN CONTAMINATION \\

\begin{tabular}{l l}


Expectation value of $<S^{**}2>$     &:     0.756107 \\
Ideal value S*(S+1) for S=0.5   &:     0.750000 \\
Deviation                       &:     0.006107 \\

\end{tabular}
\paragraph{}

Here the \textbf{FINAL SINGLE PONT ENERGY = -75.562373748559}

\subsection{Using DFT (B3LYP)}

\subsubsection{Using DEF2-SVP basis set}

Here we are going to caluculte the single pint energy of water molecule with DFT method. We are using \textbf{B3LYP} functional for our calculation and we are following the \textbf{DEF2-SVP} basis set. 
\paragraph{}
Our input file is as shown below.

\begin{minted}{python}
# The single point energy calculation using DFT method with 
# the fuctional B3LYP
# The basis set used is DEF2-SVP

!B3LYP DEF2-SVP

* xyz 0 1
O     -0.222442    1.095097   -0.000000
H      0.487836    0.874579    0.591082
H      0.063978    1.773709   -0.599958
*

\end{minted}

In the output file the \textbf{FINAL TOTAL SINGLE POINT ENERGY = -76.319970679729}
